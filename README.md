# Replugged

**WARNING**  
I do not know how to actually write Typescript nor how to proprely read it. I made this fork as I'm tired of waiting for ages for my favorite client to fix shit that already has a pull request ready for it.  
Naturally because of this, I actually don't know what the hell any of the code does. So when I mean that you should run this at your own risk, you REALLY should be!  
While I will personally risk myself using it, just note that it wouldn't be unlikely that shit hits the fan. **You've been warned.**
